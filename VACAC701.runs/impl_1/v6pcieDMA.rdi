Resolution: The get_ports call is being converted to a get_pins call as there is no direct connection to a top level port. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

Phase 9 Post Router Timing
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-249] Generated clock pcie_axi_trn_bridge_i/v7_pcie_i/gt_top_i/pipe_wrapper_i/pipe_clock_int.pipe_clock_i/clk_125mhz has no logical paths from master clock sys_clk_c.
Resolution: Review the path between the master clock and the generated clock with the schematic viewer and correct the -source option. If it is correct and the master clock does not have a timing path to the generated clock, define the generated clock as a primary clock by using create_clock.
INFO: [Route 35-20] Post Routing Timing Summary | WNS=-0.050 | TNS=-0.067 | WHS=0.053  | THS=0.000  |

CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.
